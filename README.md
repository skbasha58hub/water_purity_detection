# 💧 Smart Water Quality Analyzer using Image Processing

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **computer vision–based water quality analyzer** that uses a webcam and image processing techniques to detect suspended particles in water.  
By analyzing the number of impurities, the system determines the **potability of water**, evaluates **disease risk**, and recommends suitable **purification methods** in real time.

## 🚀 Features
- 📷 **Live Camera Feed** – Captures and analyzes water samples in real time  
- 🔍 **Particle Detection** – Detects and counts impurities using OpenCV contour detection  
- 🎚 **Threshold Adjustment** – Adjustable slider to fine-tune detection sensitivity  
- ✅ **Potability Prediction** – Predicts whether the water is safe or unsafe for drinking  
- ⚠ **Risk Level Analysis** – Classifies contamination as **Low, Moderate, or High**  
- 💡 **Purification Suggestions** – Suggests methods like **Boiling, Chlorination, UV, or RO**  
- 🖼 **Image Capture** – Saves water sample snapshots for record keeping  
- 🖥 **Visual Feedback** – Highlights impurities and displays live results on video feed
