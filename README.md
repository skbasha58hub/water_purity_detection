# water_purity_detection
This project presents a computer vision-based water quality analysis system that uses a webcam and image processing techniques to detect impurities in water samples. The system uses OpenCV, NumPy, and SciPy libraries to capture live video feed, detect suspended particles, and provide real-time feedback on water purity.
